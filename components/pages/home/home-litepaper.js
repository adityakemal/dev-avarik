                Inspired by the AI generated trends of CryptoPunks, Bored Ape
                Yacht Club, and various others, each token has been randomly
                generated and assembled from over 400+ hand-drawn attributes,
                generating a unique JRPG-style NFT.
              </p>
              <p>
                Avarik Saga is also largely influenced by notorious NFT-based
                games, such as Axie Infinity, where players battle each other to
                secure more money. The realm of Avarik Saga combines the most
                sought-after traits of the blockchain and gaming industries. It
                features collectibles, social avatars, auto battle gameplays,
                and play-to-earn functionalities in competitive gaming.
              </p>
              <p>
                Avarik Sagaâ€™s main goal is to build a next-generation
                blockchain-based metaverse of gaming NFTs, backed up by digital
                value. Avarik Saga is not just a game for blockchain players,
                but rather a game that will introduce blockchain to millions of
                players.
